Description: "No Tofu" font family for over 30 scripts
 This package provides Noto fonts which aims to provide coverage to
 all Unicode ranges. Currently it covers over 30 different script and
 more will be added in future.

 When there is no font to display a piece of text we see square boxes
 on screen which is referred as tofu, this font aims to have "No tofu"
 on the screen and hence its named as Noto.
